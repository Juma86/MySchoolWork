| Question   |	::
|            |
|            |		1)
|            |
|            |			a) #~[[[ REF. 0x00C4 ]]]~#
|            |
|            |			b) i) Coherent sources imply 2 sources with an equal phase
|            |			      difference
|            |
|            |			  ii) Since both beams of light are coming from the same source
|            |			      they must have the same phase difference
|            |
|            |			 iii) Since the light acts like a wave here, when the waves
|            |			      interact they superimpose, when they superimpose, the
|            |			      magnitude of each wave is summed for any given point
|            |			      which doubles the brightness of that area, thus causing
|            |			      a bright fringe which decays to a node where the summed
|            |			      magnitude is 0
|            |
|            |			c) i) w = dS/(lambda) where d = 0.004m and (lambda) = .000000405m
|            |			      and w = 0.00005m
|            |
