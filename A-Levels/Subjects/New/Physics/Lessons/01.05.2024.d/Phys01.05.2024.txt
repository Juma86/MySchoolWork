| Starter    |	::
|            |
|            |		1) What is the formula describing diffraction at double slits	::
|            |			w = (lambda)D/S
|            |		2) What formulae describe diffraction at a single slit or obstacle	::
|            |			W = 2(lambda)D/a && W=2w
|            |		3) What are the main differences in what you observe for diffraction of
|            |		   light by double slits compared to a single slit	::
|            |			single slit has a brighter fringe and double has dots instead
|            |			of lines
|            |		4) How is a diffraction rating similar / different to the other two	::
