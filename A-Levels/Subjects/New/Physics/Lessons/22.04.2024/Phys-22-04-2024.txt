|            |		1) what does monochromatic light mean? light of 1 wavelength
|            |
|            |		2) what does coherent (in terms of waves) mean? constant phase difference
|            |
|            |		3) how is the light from a laser source different to that of a light bulb?
|            |
|            |		4) what does polarised mean? oscillations are in the same direction
|            |
|            |	parallel light rays parallel out of laser -> collimate
