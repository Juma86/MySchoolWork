|            |		1) What is the formula describing double slit defraction?
|            |			w = (lambda)D/s
|            |
|            |		2) If you increase the wavelength of light what effect will it have on what
|            |		   you see on the screen?
|            |			the gap will get wider
|            |
|            |		3) What effect will increasing the distance between the slits have on the
|            |		   pattern you see on the screen?
|            |			the gap will get slimmer
|            |
|            |		4) What effect will halving the distance to the screen have on the pattern
|            |		   that you see on it?
|            |			the gap will get slimmer
|            |
|            |		5) What is the formula for single slit defraction?
|            |			W = 2(lambda)D/a -> WHERE a is width of single slit
|            |
|            |		6) List the key differences between the patterns you observe in double
|            |		   slit defraction versus single slit defraction
