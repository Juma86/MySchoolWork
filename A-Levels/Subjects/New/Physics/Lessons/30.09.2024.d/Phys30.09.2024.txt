|            |		1) What I Think -> Gravity is a force that draws masses together
|            |			it gets weaker exponentially as your distance from the mass increases
|            |
|            |		-- Gravity has an inverse square relationship, as opposed to the linear
|            |			relationship displayed by F = mg
|            |
|            |		-- The strength of a gravitational field g on a small mass m is the force
|            |			per unit mass :: g = F/m
|            |
|            |		-- Where F is the gravitational force acting on the mass m
|            |
