|            |		Explanation	::
|            |
|            |			Waves are split into 2 common classes : Longitudinal & Transverse
|            |
|            |			Longitudinal waves are waves where the oscillations are parallel
|            |			to the direction of travel of the wave - longitudinal waves can
|            |			be diffracted but can not be polarised and can not travel in
|            |			a vacuum. Longitudinal waves are also made up of compression and
|            |			rarefactions
|            |
|            |			Transverse waves are waves where the oscillations are
|            |			perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer - transverse
|            |			waves can be polarised and travel fastest within a
|            |			vacuum at a speed of 3 * 10^8 ms^-1
|            |
|            |			When a transverse wave is polarised it then oscillates in only
|            |			one plane. Polarisation provides evidence for the characteristics
|            |			of transverse waves as polarisation can only occur in waves where
|            |			the oscillations and the transfer of energy are perpendicular
|            |
|            |			The superposition of 2 coherent, progressive waves travelling
|            |			in opposing directions is considered a stationary wave.
|            |			A stationary wave causes no net transfer of energy.
|            |			Constructive interference occurs where 2 waves superimpose
|            |			in phase, this is an antinode and when this occurs there is
|            |			a maxima of amplitude.
|            |			Destructive interference occurs where 2 waves superimpose
|            |			entirely out of phase, this is a node and when this occurs
|            |			there is a minima of amplitude.
|            |
|            |			The first harmonic is the lowest frequency at which a stationary
|            |			wave forms, it will have 2 nodes and 1 antinode.
|            |			The distance between adjacent (anti)nodes is 1/2(lambda).
|            |			The following formula can be used to calculate the Nth harmonic:
|            |			f = N/(2L) * (sqrt { T / (mew) }) -- where:
|            |				f   = frequency,
|            |				N   = harmonic ,
|            |				L   = length of string
|            |				T   = tension in string
|            |				mew = mass per unit length
|            |
|Interference|	::
|            |
|            |		Explanation	::
|            |
|            |			Path difference is the difference in the distance travlled
|            |			by two waves
|            |
|            |			A coherent light source has the same frequency and wavelength
|            |			and a fixed phase difference. Lasers emit light
|            |			that is both coherent and monochromatic. Monochromatic meaning
|            |			there is a very small range of frequencies being produced
|            |			typically +- 1Nm
|            |
|            |			A laser is typically what is used for the source if light
|            |			in diffraction experiments as they produce a clear and well
|            |			defined interference pattern
|            |
|            |			Young's double slit experiment demonstrates inteference
|            |			of light from 2 sources. The steps are the following:
|            |
|            |				1)
|            |					Shine a coherent light source through 2 slits
|            |					about the same size as the wavelength of the
|            |					source light so the light diffracts
|            |
|            |				2)
|            |					Each slit acts as a coherent point source making
|            |					a pattern of light and dark fringes. Light
|            |					fringes are formed where the light meets in phase
|            |					and inteferes constructively, this occures where
|            |					the path difference is an integer multiple
|            |					of (lambda) e.g. n(lambda). Dark fringes are
|            |					formed where the light meets entirely out of
|            |					phase and interferes destructively, this occurs
|            |					when the path difference is an integer multiple
|            |					of (lambda) + 1/2 of a wavelength e.g.
|            |					(n+1/2)(lambda)
|            |
|            |			The formula associated with the double slit experiment is
|            |				W = (lambda)D/s
|            |					where w -> Fringe Spacing
|            |					where D -> Slit distance from screen
|            |					where s -> Slit speration
|            |					where (lambda) -> Wavelength
|            |
|            |			Using white length instead of monochromatic light
|            |			will produce wider maxima with less intense bright fringes
|            |			the fringes will be spectra of the light making up the white
|            |			light as all wavelengths will diffract differently
|            |
|Diffraction |	::
|            |
|            |		Explanation	::
|            |
|            |			Diffraction is when light spreads into what would typically
|            |			be considered it's shadow area by bending around curves
|            |			or apertures
|            |
|            |			monochromatic light can be diffracted and it's inteference
|            |			pattern would contain one bright central fringe with other
|            |			fringes with a tapering brightness as they move further
|            |			from the zero order line, it is also sharper and more intense
|            |			than the interference pattern caused by white light
|            |
|            |			The more slits in a diffraction grating, the more well defined
|            |			the interference pattern will be as there are more rays of light
|            |			making it up, for this reason a diffraction grating is more
|            |			accurate than young's double slit for measurements involving
|            |			wavelength or other
|            |
|            |			a wider slit width will cause light to diffract less and therefor
|            |			cause a more concentrated center maximum that's brighter and
|            |			thinner than otherwise, a longer wavelength will cause the light
|            |			to diffract more and make the central maximum dimmer and wider
|            |
|            |			the zero order line is the name for the central maximum of
|            |			the interference pattern which is double the width of all other
|            |			maxima, the next maxima from the zero order line would be
|            |			considered the first order line and so on and so forth
|            |
|            |			white light can also be used for diffraction, white light will
|            |			disperse into a spectrum of all frequencies making it up as
|            |			each wavelength will diffract a different amount and thus cause
|            |			the maxima of each wavelength to appear at different locations
|            |
|            |			the formula associated with diffraction is the following:
|            |				d(sin{theta})=n(lambda) where
|            |					d      = slit speration                    ,
|            |					theta  = angle from normal to focus maxima ,
|            |					n      = the focus maxima                  ,
|            |					lambda = wavelength
|            |
|            |			the formula may need to be derived during an exam, the derivation
|            |				is the following:
|            |
|            |			1)
|            |				Considering the first order maximum, where the path
|            |				difference between two adjacent rays of light is one
|            |				wavelength, name the angle between the normal to the
|            |				grating and the focus maxima theta
|            |
|            |			2)
|            |				A right angled triangle is formed with side lengths
|            |				d & lambda, since this is a right angled triangle
|            |				and the triangle's internal angles must sum to 180
|            |				the top angle must be (theta) while the other must be
|            |				90-(theta)
|            |
|            |			3)
|            |				By using triginometry we can see that:
|            |					(sin{theta}) = (lambda)/d
|            |				as (sin{theta})= (opp/hyp)
|            |				this can the rearrange to d(sin{theta})=(lambda)
|            |				for the first order only
|            |
|            |			4)
|            |				We know that the other maxima occur when
|            |				the path difference between 2 rays of light
|            |				are an integer multiple of (lambda) e.g. n
|            |
|            |				therefor we can now generalise the equation
|            |				to the following:
|            |					d(sin{theta})=n(lambda)
|            |
| Refraction |	::
|            |
|            |		Explanation	::
|            |
|            |			A refractive index is a property of non-opaque materials
|            |			that measures the speed at which light travels through it
|            |			as a ratio of the materials speed of light against
|            |			the speed of light in vacuo; for this reason, an object's
|            |			refrative index will not be below 1.
|            |
|            |			Refractive index is described by the following formula:
|            |				n = (c-vacuo)/(c-material)
|            |					where n is refractive index,
|            |					where c is speed of light
|            |
|            |			A material having a higher refractive index is synonymous
|            |			with being more optically dense as both imply a slower
|            |			speed of light within the material
|            |
|            |			Refraction occurs when light enters a material with a different
|            |			optical density and changes speed / direction
|            |			if a direction change is to occur it will move either toward or
|            |			away from the normal line depending on whether the material
|            |			the ray of light is entering is either more optically dense or
|            |			less optically dense; respectively
|            |
|            |			The equation describing refraction is named Snell's law and
|            |			is the following:
|            |				(n-1)(sin {(theta-1)}) = (n-2)(sin {(theta-2)})
|            |
|            |				where n is refractive index of each material
|            |				where (theta-1) is the angle of incidence
|            |				where (theta-2) is the angle of refraction
|            |
|            |			As the angle of incidence is increased, the angle of refraction
|            |			will approach 90 degrees, when the angle of refraction is 90
|            |			degrees and the light is refracted along the boundary, the angle
|            |			of incidence has reached the critical angle (theta-c). This angle
|            |			can be found using the following formula:
|            |				(sin {(theta-c)}) = (n-2)/(n-1) where
|            |					(n-1) > (n-2)
|            |
|            |			Total internal reflection (TIR) can occur when the angle of
|            |			incidence is greater then the critical angle and the incidence
|            |			refractive index (n-1) is greater than the refractive index of
|            |			the material at the boundary (n-2)
|            |
|            |			A useful application of TIR is in the use of optical fibres
|            |			where light is used to transmit information across a thin tube
|            |			made from glass or plastic. They would have an optically
|            |			dense core surrounded by a less optically dense cladding
|            |			that is used for TIR and also protects the core from damage
|            |			and prevents light from escaping the core which would cause
|            |			information loss
|            |
|            |			Information loss can also be caused by the following:
|            |
|            |				Absorpotion - Where part of the signal's energy is
|            |					absorbed by the fibre, thus reducing the
|            |					amplitude of the signal and causes information
|            |					loss
|            |				Dispersion - This causes pulse broadening where the
|            |					received signal is broader than the original
|            |					transmitted signal. Broadened signals can overlap
|            |					causing a loss of information
|            |				There are 2 types of dispersion:
|            |					Modal - Caused by light rays entering the fibre
|            |					at different angles, thus causing each ray to
|            |					take a different path to another, each taking
|            |					different amounts of time to traverse the fibre
|            |
|            |					Material - Caused by using light of differing
|            |					wavelengths, meaning light rays will travel at
|            |					different speeds along the fibre; this can be
|            |					avoided via the use of monochromatic light
|            |
