|Thermal Ener-

|            |
|            |		Internal energy is the summation of all randomly distributed energies
|            |		within a system in potential or kinetic form.
|            |
|            |		There are 2 ways to increase the internal energy of a system:
|            |			. Do work on the system to transfer energy to it
|            |			. Increase the temperature of the system
|            |
|            |		When the state of a substance is changed, it's internal energy also
|            |		changes, this is because the potential energy of the system changes while
|            |		the kinetic energy remains constant. This can be demonstrated by the
|            |		measurement of water's temperature as it boils:
|            |			. The temperature increases up until 100 deg-celcius, after which
|            |				the energy gained through heating the water is no longer
|            |				used to increase the themperature (and therefore kinetic
|            |				energy), but instead is used to break the bonds between
|            |				water molecules so it can change state to water vapour,
|            |				and so potential energy is increased.
|            |
|            |		You can measure the amount of energy required to change the temperature
|            |		of a substance using the following formula :: [Q = mc (delta {theta})]
|            |			Where:	Q is energy required
|            |			      	m is the mass
|            |				c is the specific heat capacity
|            |				(delta {theta}) is the change in temperature
|            |
|            |		The specific heat capacity of a substance is the amount of energy
|            |		required to increase the temperature of 1kg of a substance by 1
|            |		deg-celcius / 1 deg-kelvin without changing it's state
|            |
|            |		You can measure the quantity of energy needed to change the state of a
|            |		substance using the following formula: Q = ml
|            |			Where:	Q is energy required
|            |				m is mass
|            |				l is the specific latent heat
|            |
|            |		The specific latent heat of a substance is the amount of energy required
|            |		to change the state of 1kg of material without changing it's temperature.
|            |		there are two types of specific latent heat: the specific latent heat of
|            |		fusion (when solid changes to liquid) and specific latent heat of
|            |		vaporisation (when liquid changes to gas).
|            |
|            |		NOTE :: You will need to be able to do calculations using the above formulae
|            |				and also understand continuous-flow questions
|            |
|            |
|Ideal Gasses|	::
|            |
|            |		The gas laws describe the experimental relationship between pressure (p),
|            |		volume (v), and temperature (T) for a mixed mass of gas. They are
|            |		empirical in nature, meaning that they are not based on theory but arose
|            |		from observation and experimental evidence. The 3 gas laws you need to be
|            |		aware of are the following:
|            |			. Boyle's Law - When temperature is constant, pressure and volume
|            |			  are inversely proportional.
|            |
|            |			. Charle's Law - When pressure is constant, volume is directly
|            |			  proportional to absolute temperature.
|            |
|            |			. The pressure Law - When volume is constant, pressure is
|            |			  directly proportional to absolute temperature.
|            |
|            |		The absolute scale for temperature is the kelvin scale, where each
|            |		temperature unit is the same as the celcius scale but o degrees kelvin
|            |		is absolute 0, the conversion between kelvin and celcius is the following
|            |		formula: K = C + 273.15 (typically simplifiewd to K = C + 273 in A-level)
|            |
|            |		Absolute zero (-273 degrees C), also known as 0 degrees K, is the lowest
|            |		possible temperature, and the temperature at which particles will have
|            |		no vibrational / kinetic energy and the volume and pressure of a gas are
|            |		zero.
|            |
|            |		All 3 of the gas law formulae can be combined into 1 formula:
|            |			(p*V)/T = k, where the constant k is dependent on the amount of
|            |		gas used in moles, therefore you can rewrite the above equation to get:
|            |			pV/T=nR, where n is the number of moles of gas , and R is the
|            |		molar gas constant (8.31J mol^-1 K^-1). You can rearrange this formula
|            |		further to finally end up with:
|            |			pV = nRT, which is the ideal gas equation.
|            |				where p -> Pressure                  - Pascals (Pa)
|            |				where V -> Volume                    - m^3
|            |				where n -> number of moles           - any number
|            |				where R -> molar gas constant (8.31) - J mol^-1 K^-1
|            |				where T -> temperature               - Kelvin (K)
|            |
|            |		1 mole of a substance is equal to 6.02 * 10 ^ 23 atoms / molecules
|            |		so you can convert between the number of moles (n) and the number of
|            |		molecules(N) by multiplying the number of moles by 6.02 * 10^23,
|            |		which is defined as the Avogadro constant (N(A)).
|            |
|            |		You can substitute in the above equation into the ideal gas equation to
|            |		get it in terms of molecules rather than moles pV = NRT/(N(A)). You can
|            |		simplify this further by using the Boltzzman constant (A) which is:
|            |			R/(N(A)), leading to the equation:
|            |			pV = NkT
|            |
|            |		Molar mass is the mass (in grams) of one mole of a substance and can be
|            |		found by finding the relative molecular mass, which is (approximately)
|            |		equal to the sum of the nucleons in a molecule of the substance.
|            |
|            |		Work is done on a gas to change it's volume when it is at constant
|            |		pressure, (this is usually done through the transfer of thermal energy)
|            |		the value of work done can be calculated using the following formula:
|            |			Work done = p * (delta{V})
|            |				where p is the pressure and (delta{V}) is the change in
|            |				volume
|            |
|            |		This is especially useful when working with a graph of pressure against
|            |		volume, as work done is simply the area under the graph
|            |
|            |
|Molecular ki-
|netic theory-
| model      |	::
|            |
|            |		Brownian motion is the random motion of larger particles in a fluid
|            |		caused by collisions with surrounding particles under a microscope.
|            |		Brownian motion can be observed through looking at smoke particles under
|            |		a microscope. Brownian motion contributed to the evidence for the
|            |		existance of atoms and molecules
|            |
|            |		You can use a simple molecular model to explain each of the gas laws:
|            |			Boyle's law:
|            |				Pressure is inversely proportional to volume at constant
|            |				temperature. E.g. if you increase the volume of a fixed
|            |				mass of gas, it's molecules will move further apart so
|            |				collisions will be less frequent therefore pressure
|            |				decreases.
|            |			Charle's law:
|            |				Volume is directly proportional to temperature at
|            |				constant pressure. When the temperature of a gas is
|            |				increased, it's molecules gain kinetic energy meaning
|            |				they will move more quickly and because pressure is kept
|            |				constant (therefore frequency of collisions is constant)
|            |				the molecules move further apart and volume is increased.
|            |			Pressure law:
|            |				Pressure is directly proportional to temperature at
|            |				constant volume. When the temperature of a gas is
|            |				increased, it's molecules gain kinetic energy meaning
|            |				they will move more quickly, as volume is constant the
|            |				frequency of collisions between molecules and their
|            |				container increases and they collide at higher speeds
|            |				therefore pressure is increased.
|            |
|            |		The above laws are empirical in nature, meaning they are not based on
|            |		theory but arose from observation and experimental evidence. The kinetic
|            |		theory model however is the opposite and arose from only theory.
|            |
|            |		The kinetic theory model equation relates several features of a fixed
|            |		mass of gas, including it's pressure, volume and mean kinetic energy.
|            |		There are several underlying assumptions, which lead to the derivation
|            |		of this equation, these assumptions and the derivation are outlined
|            |		below.
|            |
|            |		Assumptions:
|            |			. No intermolecuar forces act on the molecules
|            |			. The duration of collisions is negligible in comparison to time.
|            |			  between collisions.
|            |			. The motion of the molecules follows Newton's laws.
|            |			. The molecules move in straight lines between collisions.
|            |
|            |		Derivation:
|            |			1. consider a cube with side lengths l, full of gas molecules.
|            |			   One of these molecules, has a mass m and is travelling towards
|            |			   the right-most wall of the container, with a velocity u.
|            |			   Assuming it collides with this wall elastically, it's change
|            |			   in momentum is mu-(-mu)=2mu.
|            |			2. Before this molecule can collide with this wall again it must
|            |			   travel a distance of 2l. Therefore the time between collisions
|            |			   is t, where t = 2l/u.
|            |			3. Using these two bits of information we can find the impulse,
|            |			   which is the rate of change of momentum of the molecule. As
|            |			   impulse is equal to the force exerted, we can find pressure by
|            |			   dividing our value of impulse by the area of one wall: l^2.
|            |				F = 2mu/(2l/u)) = mu^2/l
|            |				P = mu^2/l/l^2 = mu^2/l^3 = mu^2/V
|            |			   As shown, the above equation can be further simplified because
|            |			   l^3 is identical to the cube's volume (V)
|            |			4. The molecule we have considered is one of many in the cube,
|            |			   the total pressure of the gas will be the sum of all the
|            |			   individual pressures caused by each molecule.
|            |				P = (m((u(1))^2+(u(2))^"+...+(u(n)^2)/V
|            |			5. Instead of considering all these speeds seperately, we can
|            |			   define a quantity known as mean square speed, which is exactly
|            |			   what it sounds like, the mean of the square speeds of the gas
|            |			   molecules. This quantity is known as (overlined{u^2}), and we
|            |			   multiply it by N, the number of particles in the gas, to get
|            |			   an estimate of the sum of the molecules' speeds.
|            |					P = Nm(overlined{u^2})/V
|            |			6. The last step is to consider all the directions the molecules
|            |			   will be moving in. Currently we have only considered one
|            |			   dimension, however the particles will be moving in all
|            |			   3 dimensions. Using pythagoras' theorem we can work out the
|            |			   speed the molecules will be traveling at:
