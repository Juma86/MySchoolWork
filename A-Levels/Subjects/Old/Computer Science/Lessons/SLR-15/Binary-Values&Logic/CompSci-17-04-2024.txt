|Explanation |	::
|            |
|            |		Computer logic is built upon on or off values using logic gates
|            |
|            |		We don't use more values since 2 states is the simplest to accomodate for in terms
|            |		of complexity
|            |
|Definitions |	::
|            |
|            |		Boolean gates ::
|            |			NOT // Â¬ (~, !, -) // low -> high, high -> low
|            |
|            |			AND // ^ (., &)    // high, high -> high ELSE low
|            |
|            |			OR  // V (+, ||, |)  // 
|            |
|            |			XOR // V with '-' below (plus in circle, non-identity) // 
|            |

|            |			A, B, C as inputs WHERE temp, activated, deactivated by fire crew RESPECTIVELY
|            |
|            |			D as output WHERE on
|            |
|            |			D = (A|B)&!C
