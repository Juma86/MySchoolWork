			Phys { 26th of March 2024 } GCSE Recap Of Waves [ Incomplete - complete ]


Explanation ::
	A wave is a transfer of energy

Definitions ::
	Transverse    : A transverse wave is a wave where the particulates move -
	                tangentially or purpendicular to the transfer of energy .

	Longitudinal  : A longitudinal wave is a wave where the peaks and troughs -
	                are parallel to the transfer of energy                    .

	Rest position : The rest position is the organisation of particles -
			ot fields when no wave is present                  .

	Displacement  : The distance that a certain point in the medium has moved -
			from it's rest position                                   .

	Peak          : The peak is the highest point on a wave -
	                above the rest position                 .

	Trough        : The trough is the lowest point on a wave -
			below the rest position                  .

	Amplitude     : Amplitude is the maximum displacement of a point -
			on a wave from it's rest position                .

	Wavelength    : Wavelength is the distance covered -
			by a full cycle of a wave          .

	Time period   : The time it takes for a full cycle -
			of a wave to take place            .

	Frequency      : Frequency is the amount of times per second           -
			the same part of a wave cycle passes a given position .

	
Equations ::
	C = f(lambda) WHERE C = speed of wave && f = Frequency && (lambda) = WaveLength
	T = 1/f       WHERE T = Time period   && f = Frequency
	f = 1/T       WHERE f = Frequency     && T = Time Period
