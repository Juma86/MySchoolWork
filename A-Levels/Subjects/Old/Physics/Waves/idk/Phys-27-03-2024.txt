Angles Recap - Radians ::
	360 degrees = 2(Pi) radians

	1   degree  = 2    (Pi) / 360 radians
	180 degrees =      (Pi)       radians
	90  degrees = (1/2)(Pi)       radians
	270 degrees = (3/2)(Pi)       radians
	0   degrees = 0               radians

Definitions ::
	Phase Difference : A given point on one wave lags behind the exact same point on another wave -
	                   This is expressed as an angle in either degrees or radians                 -
			   1 Whole cycle behind is 360 degrees or 2(Pi) radians                       .

	Polarisation     : With transverse waves the displacement is perpendicuar to the propogation... There is still a further dimension to consider :
	                   The wave can vibrate up-down or left-right and everything in between

                           Transverse waves can be polarised but longitudinal waves can not be polarised

	Super Position   : When two waves meet whilst travelling through the same medium

	Constructive interferance : Constructive interferance is when waves superimpose to create a larger  oscillation
	Destructive interferance  : Destructive  interferance is when waves superimpose to create a smaller oscillation

	When 2 identical waves destruct perfectly traveling in opposite directions their peak is called a      node
	When 2 identical waves contruct perfectly traveling in opposite directions their peak is called an antinode

	1st harmonic : 1 node  and 1 antinode  L =  (lambda) / 2 ?=> Fundamental harmonic
	2nd harmonic : 2 nodes and 2 antinodes L =  (lambda)
	3rd harmonic : 3 nodes and 3 antinodes L = 3(lambda) / 2

Explanations :: 
	Phase Differences =>
		assuming the wave starts a cycle with an instantaneous positive gradient with an instantaneous amplitude of 0:
			the first peak would be a 90 degree offset or a (1/2)(Pi) offset in radians.
		where the wave next has an instantaneous amplitude of 0 with an instaneous negative gradient
			the offset is 180 degrees or (Pi)/2 radians
		where the wave has a trough would be 270 degrees or (3/2)(Pi) radians
		where the wave next has an instantaneous amplitude of 0 and an instantenous positive gradient -
			it will have a phase of 360 degrees or 0 degrees                                      .
		
		If 2 waves are  (Pi) radians out of phase then they will combine to form a smooth wave
			for the period that they are passing through eachother
		If 2 waves are 2(Pi) radians out of phase then they will combine to form a wave with a summed amplitude
			for the period that they are passing through eachother

		The concept of phase is important when we look at superposition (combining waves) & interference

	Polarising Filter =>
		A polarising filter is a filter that will only allow waves through with a certain polarisation / angle
			When 2 polarising Filters are placed infront of eachother 90 degrees out of phase no light will get through

	Malus' Law =>
		If two polaroid filters are at an angle to eachother, only the vertical component
				from the plane of oscillation will transmit through.

Equations ::
	L = (1/2)n(lambda)

	f = v / (lambda)
	  = sqrt(T/(mew))/(2L)
	  = (1/(2L))sqrt(T/(mew))
		WHERE f = frequency && v = velocity && T = tension && (mew) = unit length

	v = sqrt(T/(mew))
		WHERE v = velocity && T = tension && (mew) = unit length
